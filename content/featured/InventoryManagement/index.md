Implemented an Inventory Management System using different design patterns to build a robust and flexible web application that helps manage inventory for a retail store. The application allows users to add new products, edit existing products, and delete products that are no longer needed. The application is built using Java and Spring Boot on the back-end, and React.js on the front-end.
